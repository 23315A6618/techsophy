Insurance claims can vary in complexity. This system:

- Processes claim documents (PDFs, images)
- Extracts and classifies claims as *simple* or *complex*
- Extracts key claim information (amounts, parties, dates)
- Assigns complexity scores based on multiple indicators
- Routes simple claims for auto-processing and complex ones to humans â€” with priority!
